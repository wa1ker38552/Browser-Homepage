# Browser-Homepage v3.0
A minimalistic custom homepage for myself. Includes shortcuts, bookmarks, custom backgrouns, and search engine choosing.

v2 is located in `/Legacy/`

**Shortcuts** <br>
**/** ~ Selects the search bar <br>
**esc** ~ Clears the search bar and unselects it <br>
**g** ~ Sets the search engine to Google <br>
**b** ~ Sets the search engine to Bing <br>
**d** ~ Sets the search engine to DuckDuckGo <br>
**** ~ Sets the search engine to Brave <br>
**enter** ~ Searches using the selected engine for {keyword} <br>
**shift+enter** ~ Directly puts the {keyword} into the search bar. (If it doesn't contain https:// it will add it for you) <br>
**ctrl+x** ~ Toggles settings modal <br>

New features include a huge variety of settings to change. Pretty much everything can be changed in settings now. Additionally, settings should no longer disappear as they're stored in localStorage. Settings can now also be imported and exported (a dictionary encoded in base64). However I removed the feature where you can set your own font as that feature was confusing and hard to use. Bookmarks will be added soon!
