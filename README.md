# Browser-Homepage
A minimalistic custom homepage for myself. Includes shortcuts, bookmarks, and search engine choosing.

**Shortcuts** <br>

**esc** ~ Clears the search bar and unselects it <br>
**g | G** ~ Sets the search engine to Google <br>
**b | B** ~ Sets the search engine to Bing <br>
**d | D** ~ Sets the search engine to DuckDuckGo <br>
**r | R** ~ Sets the search engine to Brave <br>
**enter** ~ Searches using the selected engine for {keyword} <br>
**shift+enter** ~ Directly puts the {keyword} into the search bar. (If it doesn't contain https:// it will add it for you)
**ctrl+x** ~ Toggles image settings
**alt+s** ~ Save current image settings
**alt+c** ~ Close current image settings
